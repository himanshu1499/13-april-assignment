    "Random Forest Regressor is a type of ensemble learning algorithm used in machine learning for regression tasks. It is based on the Random Forest algorithm, which is an extension of decision tree models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor creates a large number of decision trees on random subsets of the training data, and then averages the predictions of all the trees to produce the final output. Each decision tree is trained on a subset of the features, which introduces randomness into the model and helps to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor is a popular algorithm for regression tasks because it has several advantages over traditional regression models. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Robustness to outliers: Random Forest Regressor is less sensitive to outliers than linear regression models, which can improve the accuracy of the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-linearity: Random Forest Regressor can capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable, which can improve the accuracy of the predictions.\n",

    "1. **Ensemble vs Single Model:** Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make a final prediction, while Decision Tree Regressor is a single model that makes predictions based on a single decision tree.\n",
